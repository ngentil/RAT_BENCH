## 1. Foundation

| Feature | Status | Depends on | Tier |
|---------|--------|-----------|------|
| Supabase Auth (email/pass, anon guest) | ✅ | — | Free |
| Branded email templates (confirm signup + reset password) | ✅ | supabase/email-templates/ — paste into Supabase Auth → Email Templates | Free |
| OAuth: Google sign-in | ✅ | AuthScreen, Supabase Auth | Free |
| OAuth: Facebook sign-in | ❌ | Removed — Meta requires business verification | — |
| OAuth: Apple sign-in | 📋 | Queued — code removed for now, add back when needed | Free |
| Signup: confirm password + username validation | ✅ | AuthScreen | Free |
| Signup: live username availability check (✓/✗) + 🎲 dice generator | ✅ | AuthScreen, lib/username.js | Free |
| Auto-create profile on first login | ✅ | App.jsx loadForSession — uses get_my_profile() SECURITY DEFINER RPC first; if no row exists, calls create_my_profile() SECURITY DEFINER RPC (run supabase/create_profile_rpc.sql) which inserts the row bypassing RLS (profiles table has no INSERT policy — creation was always meant to go through SECURITY DEFINER paths); username comes from signup metadata or `user_{id6}` fallback; idempotent (returns existing row if already created by trigger); OnboardingScreen removed; profile load failure shows "Please refresh" error state; profileChecked resets on every loadForSession call so loading screen gates re-auth fetches | Free |
| Password reset | ✅ | auth | Free |
| Guest upgrade modal + profile banner | ✅ | auth — "Save Your Data" green banner shown at top of Profile settings page for anonymous users, above all other sections | Free |
| Profiles table + RLS | ✅ | auth.users — run supabase/org_and_profiles_rls.sql; SELECT restricted by column-level GRANT to safe public fields (id, display_name, username, units, default_status, tab_order, preferences, storage_policy_enabled, storage_tiers, tier, company_id, created_at) — sensitive fields (pending_code, stripe_customer_id, stripe_subscription_id) hidden from other users; get_my_profile() SECURITY DEFINER RPC returns full own-row data including sensitive fields; UPDATE own row only with column-level GRANT restricting writable columns to safe fields; tier/stripe/pending_* require SECURITY DEFINER path; same column-level protection on companies table | Free |
| Tier system (`gates.js`) — Free / Enthusiast $3.50wk / Business $10wk | ✅ | profiles.tier | All |
| Stripe Checkout (3 plans: Free / Enthusiast / Business) | ✅ | Stripe, profiles — create-checkout edge fn verifies JWT + confirms caller matches user_id; company billing verifies caller is owner or admin; success_url/cancel_url validated against ratbench.net allowlist; price_id validated against env vars; CORS restricted to ratbench.net origins; internal errors return generic 500 | All |
| Stripe webhook → tier update | ✅ | Stripe, profiles/companies — signature verified with constructEventAsync; PRICE_ENTHUSIAST → 'enthusiast', PRICE_PRO → 'business' (was 'team' which never unlocked org features gated on tier==='business'); unmapped price IDs log an error; subscription.updated checks sub.status — past_due/incomplete/unpaid/paused immediately downgrade to free; signature failure returns generic message (no err.message leak) | All |
| Billing portal (manage/cancel) | ✅ | Stripe customer ID — create-portal edge fn verifies JWT + caller identity; company billing restricted to owner/admin role (viewers/technicians blocked); 30s cooldown via _set_portal_session_at() RPC; CORS restricted to ratbench.net origins; internal errors return generic 500 (not err.message); run supabase/portal_rate_limit.sql | All |
| Announcements (in-app banners) | ✅ | profiles.tier — RLS: SELECT for all authenticated; INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE restricted to admin email only (run supabase/announcements_rls.sql) | All |
| Machines RLS (own + provisioned policies) | ✅ | scalability_hardening.sql + supabase/provisioned_update_checks.sql — run provisioned_update_checks.sql to add WITH CHECK to machines/vehicles/equipment/tools provisioned UPDATE policies (prevents provisioned users from changing user_id to steal asset ownership); also adds SECURITY DEFINER _machine/vehicle/equipment/tool_owner() helpers and asset_permissions.asset_type CHECK constraint | All |
| DB-level machine limit trigger (free=5, guest=3) | ✅ | scalability_hardening.sql + supabase/guest_limit_is_anonymous_fix.sql — enforce_machine_limit uses FOR UPDATE on profiles row; enforce_guest_machine_limit updated to read auth.users.is_anonymous (DB-managed, non-writable column) instead of raw_user_meta_data->>'is_anonymous' (user-writable via supabase.auth.updateUser, allowing bypass of the 3-machine guest cap) | Free |
| Critical DB indexes (machines, services, bookings, permissions) | ✅ | scalability_hardening.sql + supabase/missing_fk_indexes.sql — adds 9 missing indexes: company_id on company_members/asset_permissions/vehicles/equipment/tools/consumables/machine_permissions; wiki_revisions.entry_id; wiki_entries.created_by; without idx_company_members_company_id each _is_company_member/_is_company_admin call (fired on every policy evaluation) was a sequential scan | All |
| Checkout rate-limit (blocks duplicate Stripe sessions) | ✅ | create-checkout edge fn | All |
| Sentry error tracking | ✅ | VITE_SENTRY_DSN env var | All |
| Machine types: Snowmobile + Standalone Engine | ✅ | machineTypes.js — added Snowmobile (❄️, in MOTO array so gets drivetrain/suspension/brakes/electrics sections; excluded from showTyres since snowmobiles have tracks not tyres) and Standalone Engine (🔩, bare engines like Honda GX390/Kohler Command; shows engine/ignition/starter/fuel/PTO sections, hides drivetrain/suspension/brakes/tyres); both added to MACHINE_TYPES dropdown, TYPE_PH placeholders, and ALL_TYPES; wikipedia-import.mjs detectType() and all BRANDS defaultType values updated to use correct strings matching constants (ATV→Quad Bike, Jet Ski→Jet Ski / PWC, Outboard→Outboard Motor, Engine→Standalone Engine, Tiller→Tiller / Cultivator) | All |
| Super admins | ✅ | Two hardcoded super admins: nathan.gentil.ai@gmail.com + nathan.gentil@gmail.com — all server-side checks use `auth.email() NOT IN (...)` / `IN (...)`; client-side uses `ADMIN_EMAILS.includes()` array in AdminPanel, SettingsPage, WikiEntryPage; re-run all admin SQL files to apply to DB | Admin only |
| Admin panel analytics (users, active, machines, signups trend) | ✅ | AdminPanel.jsx OverviewTab + admin_get_stats() RPC — run supabase/admin_get_stats.sql to update; server-side auth.email() check blocks non-admin calls; GRANT EXECUTE TO authenticated added (was missing, caused silent 403 failures); VITE_ADMIN_EMAIL fallback corrected to nathan.gentil.ai@gmail.com to match SQL (all three client files: AdminPanel, SettingsPage, WikiEntryPage) | Admin only |
| Admin: list / search users | ✅ | AdminPanel.jsx UsersTab + admin_list_users(p_search, p_limit, p_offset) RPC — run supabase/admin_rpcs.sql; returns id, email, display_name, username, tier, created_at, last_sign_in_at, machine_count; server-side auth.email() check | Admin only |
| Admin: set user tier | ✅ | AdminPanel.jsx UsersTab tier select + admin_set_tier(p_email, p_tier) RPC — run supabase/admin_rpcs.sql; server-side auth.email() check; p_tier validated against allowlist (free/enthusiast/team/business) — arbitrary strings rejected; audited to admin_audit_log | Admin only |
| Admin: deactivate user (reset to free) | ✅ | AdminPanel.jsx UsersTab Deactivate button + admin_deactivate_user(p_email) RPC — run supabase/admin_rpcs.sql; clears stripe_subscription_id; audited | Admin only |
| Admin: hard-delete user from Supabase + all data + storage photos | ✅ | AdminPanel.jsx UsersTab Delete button + admin_delete_user() RPC + deleteUserPhotos() — run supabase/wiki_nullable_author_cols.sql THEN supabase/admin_delete_user.sql AND supabase/admin_storage_policy.sql — cleans: company_members, machine_permissions, asset_permissions, services, machine_bookings, machines, clients, inventory_items, vehicles, equipment, tools, consumables, asset_assignments, profiles, auth.users; wiki content is PRESERVED — created_by/edited_by/user_id NULLed instead of deleted (requires wiki_nullable_author_cols.sql run first); revision history shows "username · user retired" in grey for orphaned contributions; if sole company owner, company tier reset to free; server-side auth.email() admin guard | Admin only |
| Admin: delete wiki entries by a specific user | ✅ | AdminPanel.jsx UsersTab Del Wiki button + admin_delete_user_wiki(uuid) RPC — run supabase/admin_delete_user_wiki.sql; server-side auth.email() check prevents any authenticated user from calling it; wiki deletion order: contributions+revisions on user's entries first (prevents FK violation when other contributors have rows referencing those entries), then entries, then user's own revisions/contributions on other entries | Admin only |
| Admin: delete individual wiki entry | ✅ | WikiEntryPage — admin delete button visible when VITE_ADMIN_EMAIL matches; deleteWikiEntry() manually deletes contributions + revisions before entry | Admin only |
| Admin: bulk-delete all wiki entries | ✅ | admin_delete_all_wiki() RPC — run supabase/admin_delete_wiki.sql; deletes contributions, revisions, and entries in order; server-side auth.email() check | Admin only |
| Admin audit log | ✅ | admin_audit_log table — run supabase/admin_tables_rls.sql; append-only: admin has SELECT only (no UPDATE/DELETE policy — prevents admin from erasing their own audit trail); SECURITY DEFINER RPCs bypass RLS for INSERT writes; AuditTab reads last 200 entries | Admin only |
| Feature flags table | ✅ | feature_flags table — run supabase/admin_tables_rls.sql; admin can create/toggle/delete; all authenticated users can SELECT (for client-side gating); managed from AdminPanel FlagsTab | Admin only |
| Admin: storage photo cleanup on user delete | ✅ | is_admin_user() storage policy — run supabase/admin_storage_policy.sql; checks auth.email() = admin email; GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION is_admin_user() TO authenticated added (without it, storage policy evaluation fails for authenticated role and admin photo deletions silently no-op on other users' folders) | Admin only |
| upgrade_grants table + RLS | ✅ | Stores admin-issued tier grants (email + tier + expiry); run supabase/upgrade_grants_rls.sql — admin-only SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE; without RLS any authenticated user could read all grant records | Admin only |
| Upgrade grant RPCs (grant / revoke / apply) | ✅ | run supabase/apply_pending_upgrade_rpc.sql — creates upgrade_grants table + pending_* columns on profiles; grant_upgrade(email, tier): admin-only, generates code, sets pending_code/pending_tier/pending_code_expires_at on target profile; revoke_upgrade(email): admin-only, expires grant and clears pending columns; apply_pending_upgrade(): called by user from ProfileSettings, validates code; uses profiles FOR UPDATE lock + atomic UPDATE upgrade_grants SET redeemed_at = now() RETURNING id to claim the grant in a single statement (prevents TOCTOU where two concurrent callers could both pass the redeemed_at IS NULL check); upgrades profile tier, audits | Admin + All |
| Photo viewer: X button + Android back button closes viewer | ✅ | PhotoViewer.jsx — manualClose() pattern (stopPropagation on X prevents double history.back), 52px tap target | All |
| Machine card: Android back button collapses expanded card | ✅ | MachineCard.jsx — pushState({ cardOpen: id }) on expand, popstate listener collapses it | All |
| Android PWA: "Press back again to exit" toast | ✅ | src/lib/backGuard.js — installBackGuard() called in main.jsx before React renders; 2 s window | All |
| Wipe all base64 photos from DB | ✅ | supabase/wipe_photos.sql — run once in SQL Editor (irreversible) | Admin only |
| Photo storage — Supabase Storage bucket | ✅ | supabase/create_photos_bucket.sql + src/lib/storage.js — run SQL first, then deploy; PhotoAdder rejects files over 50MB client-side before canvas resize attempt | All |
| Photo bucket listing lockdown | ✅ | supabase/fix_photos_bucket_listing.sql (applied to prod 2026-07-03) — replaced the blanket "public read photos" SELECT policy (which let any client enumerate the whole bucket via the Storage list API) with scoped policies: "users list own photos" (authenticated, own {uid}/ folder only — needed by deleteUserPhotos) + "admin list any photo" (is_admin_user(), for the admin Delete-User flow). Object display is unaffected — the app renders via getPublicUrl() CDN links which bypass storage.objects RLS on a public bucket (bucket public=true) | All |
| Wiki data cleanup: mislabeled motorcycle imports | ✅ | supabase/wiki_cleanup_mislabeled_imports.sql (applied 2026-07-03) — the Wikipedia motorcycle import left 87 rows where make/model named two different brands (e.g. make="Aprilia" model="Honda VFR750R"); deleted 84 that duplicated an existing correct entry (FK-safe: contributions→null current_rev_id→revisions→entries), relabeled 2 unique ones from the model, left the Triumph Daytona 600 false positive; live non-sample entries 1184→1100 | Admin only |
| Photo cleanup on asset delete | ✅ | deletePhoto() in storage.js called when deleting: machines (deleteMachineApi — fetches main+port photos from machines table + plug/job photos from services table before row delete), vehicles (fetches photos + service_log plugPhoto/jobPhotos), equipment (same), tools (same), clients (deleteClientApi now fetches photos column before row delete), parts (fetches payload.photos before row delete), consumables (deleteConsumable fetches photos column before row delete) | All |
| Photo cleanup on service log entry delete | ✅ | MachineCard delSvc: collects plugPhoto + jobPhotos from svc state before deleteServiceApi; VehiclesTab removeSvcEntry: same (vehicle entries use ServiceModal which adds photos); tools/equipment service log entries are inline-only (no photos, no cleanup needed) | All |
| Preconnect hints (Fonts + Supabase dns-prefetch) | ✅ | index.html | All |
| Non-blocking announcements fetch (deferred after first paint) | ✅ | App.jsx IIFE after setInitializing — tier filter uses effectiveTier(profileData, companyData) so company-billed users see announcements targeted at their effective tier (previously used profile.tier alone which is 'free' for company members) | All |
| Auto-retry on total load failure + friendly slow-connection message | ✅ | App.jsx loadForSession — if 4+ parallel fetches fail, waits 2 s and retries once silently; loading screen shows "Taking a bit longer than usual… slow connection — giving it another go" during the wait instead of alarming the user | All |
| Service worker / PWA static asset cache (repeat-visit perf) | ✅ | vite-plugin-pwa, dist/sw.js | All |
| Shared `UpgradeBanner` component (green box, label, Upgrade → button) | ✅ | src/components/ui/UpgradeBanner.jsx — used in JobBoard, ServiceReminders, VehiclesTab, EquipmentTab, ToolsTab, StockItemTab, WikiTab | All |

## 10. Asset Tracking (Vehicles / Equipment / Tools)

| Feature | Status | Depends on | Tier |
|---------|--------|-----------|------|
| asset_permissions table + RLS | ✅ | auth.users, company_members — run supabase/provisioned_update_checks.sql to enforce CHECK constraint on asset_type (valid: vehicle/equipment/tool/consumable/part); provisioned UPDATE policies on all asset tables now have WITH CHECK to prevent ownership theft | Business |

---

## 11. Team & Organisation

| Feature | Status | Depends on | Tier |
|---------|--------|-----------|------|
| companies table + RLS | ✅ | profiles — run supabase/org_and_profiles_rls.sql; members read; admins update (column-level REVOKE/GRANT blocks direct writes to tier/stripe_customer_id/stripe_subscription_id — only SECURITY DEFINER edge functions can write those); _is_company_member / _is_company_admin SECURITY DEFINER helpers avoid asset_permissions recursion; direct INSERT policy removed (rpc_create_company is SECURITY DEFINER and handles both the company row and company_members seeding atomically — open INSERT policy would create ownerless companies) | Business |
| Create / edit company | ✅ | companies — run supabase/company_rpcs.sql then supabase/company_columns_restrict.sql; rpc_create_company SECURITY DEFINER creates row + seeds owner; REVOKE SELECT on companies restricts authenticated reads to safe columns (excludes stripe_customer_id/stripe_subscription_id); get_my_company(p_company_id) SECURITY DEFINER RPC returns full row for company members; getMyCompany() in users.js uses RPC instead of select("*") | Business |
| Invite code join flow | ✅ | companies.invite_code — run supabase/company_rpcs.sql (defines join_company_by_invite SECURITY DEFINER: matches invite_code, inserts member as 'viewer' role, links profile; blocks joining if already a member of a different org — must leave first; original 'member' role violated the role CHECK constraint) | Business |
| company_members table | ✅ | companies, profiles — RLS: members read own company list; admins manage; users can leave; run supabase/org_and_profiles_rls.sql then supabase/company_members_no_direct_insert.sql; cm_manage split into cm_manage_update + cm_manage_delete (no INSERT) — all member additions must go through join_company_by_invite SECURITY DEFINER RPC (direct INSERT allowed a compromised admin to add arbitrary users at any role, bypassing the invite flow's role='viewer' enforcement); CHECK constraint enforces valid role values at DB level | Business |
| Roles: owner / admin / technician / viewer | ✅ | company_members.role — DB CHECK constraint enforces valid values; role='owner' cannot be set via direct UPDATE (requires SECURITY DEFINER RPC) | Business |
| Edit member roles | ✅ | updateMemberRole() — UsersTab derives isOwner and isMemberOwner from company_members.role in the loaded members list (company.owner_id column never existed; using it made isOwner always false, locking the owner out of all management actions and exposing the owner's role to change) | Business |
| Remove member | ✅ | rpc_remove_member() — run supabase/delete_cascade_fixes.sql; verifies caller is owner/admin; blocks removing the company owner (would orphan company permanently); cleans machine_permissions, asset_permissions, vehicle crew assignments; uuid columns in DELETE queries use direct uuid comparison (::text casts removed — casts prevented index use) | Business |
| Leave company (self) | ✅ | rpc_leave_company(p_company_id) — run supabase/rpc_leave_company.sql; cleans machine_permissions and asset_permissions for that company before removing the company_members row and clearing profiles.company_id; previously leaveCompany only deleted the members row, leaving orphaned provisioned access; owner is blocked from leaving (must transfer ownership or delete company first) | Business |
| Delete company | ✅ | deleteCompany() → rpc_delete_company SECURITY DEFINER — run supabase/company_rpcs.sql; clears profiles.company_id for all members, removes asset_permissions, company_members, then company row (FK SET NULL handles machines/vehicles/etc.) | Business |
| Regenerate invite code | ✅ | regenerateInviteCode() — uses crypto.randomUUID() (CSPRNG) for the 8-char code | Business |
| Company logo upload | ✅ | companies.logo (base64) | Business |
| Hourly rate / tax rate / tax label config | ✅ | companies fields — edited in Settings → Billing & Storage (moved from CompanySettings; saved via updateCompany()) | Any tier with org |
| Machine provisioning panel (CompanySettings) | ✅ | machine_permissions — run supabase/create_machine_permissions.sql; machine_perms_update policy now has explicit WITH CHECK (prevents machine owner changing machine_id to a machine they don't own in a single UPDATE) | Business |
| Asset provisioning panel (vehicles/equip/tools) | ✅ | asset_permissions, CompanySettings | Business |

## 12. Wiki

| Feature | Status | Depends on | Tier |
|---------|--------|-----------|------|
| wiki_entries table | ✅ | — | Free |
| wiki_revisions table | ✅ | wiki_entries — run supabase/wiki_revisions_rls_helper.sql; SELECT policy uses _wiki_entry_visible() SECURITY DEFINER helper (decouples revisions RLS from wiki_entries RLS — without the helper, future wiki_entries policies could silently break revision SELECT) | Enthusiast+ |
| Browse + search wiki | ✅ | wiki_entries — SELECT RLS: non-sample entries public; sample entries visible to owner only; INSERT WITH CHECK: created_by = auth.uid() AND (NOT is_sample OR sample_owner_id = auth.uid()) — blocks injecting fake sample entries into another user's sample library; UPDATE RLS restricted to entry author; column-level REVOKE/GRANT limits author updates to make/model/type/slug; slug CHECK constraint (^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*$); run supabase/wiki_rls.sql; server-side fuzzy search via search_wiki(q, lim) RPC (supabase/wiki_fuzzy_search_rpc.sql, SECURITY INVOKER so wiki_entries RLS still applies, requires pg_trgm): Stage 1 = despaced-substring AND match — each whitespace token is stripped of spaces/hyphens and must be a substring of the entry's despaced make+model+type+slug, so spacing/hyphenation is irrelevant in BOTH directions ("ms441"↔"MS 441", "seadoo"↔"Sea-Doo", "hondagx200"↔"Honda GX200"), order-independent, ordered by view_count; Stage 2 (only if Stage 1 empty) = pg_trgm word_similarity on make / make+model vs raw query > 0.42 so brand typos resolve ("honfa"→Honda, "kawaski"→Kawasaki, "yamahaa"→Yamaha) — pure transpositions like "sthil" still miss (trigram limitation); empty query returns most-viewed; client searchWiki() just calls the RPC; tokenizeSearch() retained client-side only for result highlighting — simplified to a single trimmed substring (matches the tracker's Spec Search tab model) rather than splitting at letter↔digit boundaries, so what's highlighted is exactly what was typed; at ~1k entries the per-query normalized scan is sub-ms — if the wiki grows large add a normalized generated column + GIN trgm index — if AND returns 0 results falls back to OR of all tokens ranked client-side by how many tokens each entry matches (next-best-match); matched substring highlighted in green (shared hl() helper in wikiSearchHighlight.jsx, used by both WikiHomePage's result rows — make, model, type badge, slug — and WikiEntryPage, see below); if the only match is in the slug field the slug is shown as context | Free |
| Wiki collaborative rev pointer | ✅ | update_wiki_rev_pointer(p_entry_id, p_rev_id) RPC — run supabase/wiki_advance_rev_rpc.sql then supabase/wiki_rev_pointer_lock.sql; SECURITY DEFINER; caller must be entry author or contributor AND target revision author or entry author; FOR UPDATE row lock on wiki_entries serializes concurrent calls (eliminates TOCTOU race where two simultaneous edits could orphan one revision from current_rev_id); IS DISTINCT FROM guard makes duplicate calls idempotent | Free |
| View count tracking | ✅ | wiki_entries.view_count + increment_wiki_views() RPC — run supabase/wiki_view_count_rpc.sql then supabase/wiki_view_count_anon_fix.sql; SECURITY DEFINER RPC restricted to authenticated only (anon grant removed — bots could inflate counts without authenticating); WHERE clause includes AND NOT is_sample so sample entries never accumulate view counts; client-side per-session Set in wiki.js prevents the same entry from being incremented more than once per page load | Free |
| Create / edit wiki entry | ✅ | wiki_entries | Enthusiast+ |
| Field-level editing with edit summary | ✅ | wiki_revisions | Enthusiast+ |
| Full revision history | ✅ | wiki_revisions | Enthusiast+ |
| Submit machine specs to wiki | ✅ | machines → wiki_entries | Enthusiast+ |
| Wiki pre-populate on Add Machine | ✅ | MachineForm.jsx — when adding a new machine, 800ms debounce triggers lookupWikiEntry(make,model,userId) (wiki.js) which does a case-insensitive exact make+model column match so it finds both public non-sample entries and the user's own sample entries (slug-based lookup missed sample entries whose slugs are suffixed with -sample-{uid8}) after both make+model are typed; if a wiki entry with a current revision exists, a green inline banner appears below the make/model row: "Wiki match — [Make] [Model] · pre-fill known specs?" with disclaimer "Community data · always verify before use · the more specs users contribute, the more accurate future pre-fills become"; Pre-fill button calls applyWikiSuggestion() which maps every wiki specData key to its corresponding form state setter (identity, engine, ignition, starter, fuel/injection, cooling, turbo, bore/stroke/piston/rings/gudgeon/crank/conrod/cylinder, PTO/shaft, drivetrain, suspension, brakes, tyres, blade/deck, chainsaw bar+chain, outboard, pump, generator, fluids, service intervals, dimensions); only fills empty fields — never overwrites existing user input; handles key-name differences between sample entries and user-submitted entries (frontBrakeType→frontBrake, tyreSizeFront→tyreFront, lengthMm→overallLength, widthMm→overallWidth, heightMm→overallHeight, weightKg→dryWeight); also fills carb brand/model (cBrand, cModel); Skip/✕ dismiss the banner; no banner shown when editing an existing machine; all sections containing pre-filled data are auto-expanded so values are immediately visible; value normalization: coolingType "Air-cooled"→"Air cooled" / "Liquid-cooled (…)"→"Liquid cooled" to match COOLING_TYPES select options, fuelSystem "Carburettor"→"Carburetted" to match fuel delivery toggle; cBrand also fills carbBrandSpec (CarbSpec section select, visible for 2-stroke and carburetted 4-stroke) and triggers setSecCarbSpec(true); cooling data (coolingType/coolantType/coolantCapacity/thermostatTemp) and fuel tank/mix (fuelTankCapacity/mixRatio) all render in secFluids — expand trigger corrected from dead secCooling variable to setSecFluids(true); starterType expand corrected to setSecIgnition since starter renders inside the Ignition section; num() helper strips unit suffixes before filling type="number" inputs — wiki sample data stores values like "196cc", "120 PSI", "1400 ±150 RPM", "0.15mm (cold)" which browsers silently reject in number inputs leaving fields blank even though state is set (computed displays still worked); num() extracts the first decimal number from any string (e.g. "8.5:1"→"8.5") applied to all ~45 numeric fields in applyWikiSuggestion; select field normalization: wiki data uses descriptive strings that don't match option values — regex normalizers added for valveTrain ("OHV — 2 valves per cylinder"→"Pushrod (OHV)", "DOHC — 4 valves"→"DOHC", "OHC — 2 valves"→"OHC"), starterType ("Recoil"→"Recoil only", "Electric"→"Electric / key start only", "Electric + kick"→"Recoil + electric"), transType ("6-speed manual"→"Manual", "4-speed semi-auto"→"Semi-auto / Paddle shift"), clutchType ("Wet multi-plate"→"Multi-plate wet", "Centrifugal drum"→"Centrifugal"), forkType ("KYB 48mm USD Cartridge"→"USD", "Telescopic"→"Telescopic fork"), rearShockType ("KYB Link-type Monocross"→"Monoshock"), frontBrake/rearBrake ("Single hydraulic disc — 250mm"→"Disc") | Free |
| Wiki autocomplete on Make/Model fields | ✅ | MachineForm.jsx — WikiAutocomplete component wraps make (non-vehicle types) and model inputs; 200ms debounce calls getWikiMakes(query) / getWikiModels(make, query) in wiki.js (ilike on wiki_entries, is_sample=false only); results sorted prefix-first then alphabetical; model suggestions scoped to the typed make via ilike filter; dropdown supports keyboard nav (↑↓ Enter Esc); free-text entry still works — suggestions are optional; vehicle make retains VEHICLE_MAKES select | Free |
| Author attribution | ✅ | wiki_revisions.author_id | Enthusiast+ |
| Admin delete any wiki entry | ✅ | VITE_ADMIN_EMAIL env var check in WikiEntryPage, deleteWikiEntry() | Admin only |
| Admin inline field editing on wiki entry page | ✅ | WikiEntryPage.jsx — ✏ edit button only shown when session email is in ADMIN_EMAILS (nathan.gentil.ai@gmail.com + nathan.gentil@gmail.com); non-admin users cannot see or trigger inline field edits; edit targets revData, calls saveWikiFieldEdit() to write a new revision; Enter=save, Escape=cancel | Admin only |
| Wiki entry: last-editor attribution | ✅ | WikiEntryPage.jsx — shows "Last updated by [username] · [date]" below the top bar using entry.currentRevision.username + created_at; edit_summary shown if non-default (hidden when "Updated specs"); date formatted with toLocaleDateString | Free |
| Wiki entry: Add to Garage import | ✅ | WikiEntryPage.jsx + upsertMachine() — logged-in users (profile exists) see "+ Add to Garage" button; calls upsertMachine({make, model, type, ...specOnly}) without an ID so it always inserts a new machine; button replaced by "✓ Added to garage" confirmation after success and cannot be clicked again; importing=true shows "Adding…" and disables button | Free |
| Wiki field labels: motorcycle/ATV/powersports fields | ✅ | wiki.js WIKI_FIELD_LABELS — added wotPower (Max Power), torqueNm (Max Torque N·m), topSpeed (Top Speed), frameType (Frame Type), wheelbaseMm (Wheelbase mm), seatHeightMm (Seat Height mm), groundClearanceMm (Ground Clearance mm); these fields now display on the wiki entry page spec grid for motorcycle/ATV/snowmobile/PWC entries imported from Wikipedia | Free |
| Wiki entry: contribution disclaimer | ✅ | WikiEntryPage.jsx — static box at bottom of every wiki entry page: "Is this information correct? … add this machine to your garage using + Add to Garage, fill in any missing details, then tap Push to Wiki on your machine. Your update will appear here with your name attached." — guides community corrections through the garage flow rather than direct wiki edits | Free |
| Wiki entry: search term stays highlighted after clicking through | ✅ | WikiHomePage.jsx persists the trimmed query before navigating to an entry — sessionStorage (key wikiSearchQuery) for the embedded in-app tab switch, a `?q=` URL param for the standalone wiki.ratbench.net page (WikiApp.jsx); WikiEntryPage.jsx reads it back via getIncomingSearchQuery(embedded), tokenizes with the same tokenizeSearch(), and runs it through the shared hl() helper across the make/model header, type badge, and every populated spec field value (including notes) — previously the entry page had no highlighting at all, even when you'd just searched for the term that led you there | Free |
| Wiki entry: Notes field full-width + legible | ✅ | WikiEntryPage.jsx spec grid — the "notes" key is special-cased with gridColumn:"1 / -1" to span both columns of the 1fr/1fr grid instead of sharing a narrow half-width box with short fields like Bore Diameter; value text bumped to 14px/1.65 line-height (vs 12px/1.3 for other fields) with white-space:pre-wrap, since notes tend to be long-form paragraphs rather than short spec values | Free |
| ~~Per-user sample wiki entries~~ | ❌ removed | seedSampleWikiEntries() and SAMPLE_ENTRIES deleted from wiki.js; WikiHomePage seeding useEffect removed; lookupWikiEntry userId param removed (always filters is_sample=false); existing DB rows cleaned up via scripts/wiki-import/remove-sample-entries.mjs (wiki-cleanup workflow, task=remove-samples) | — |

training-data-seed-10.mjs (~40 2-stroke RC/hobby engines — DLE-20/DLE-30/DLE-35/DLE-55/DLE-60/DLE-85/DLE-111/DLE-120/DLE-170/DLE-222 twin, EME-35/70/120/300B, 3W-28i/55i/106CS twin, DA-35/DA-50/DA-70/DA-85/DA-120/DA-150, OS GT15/GT33/GT60 petrol, Zenoah G20EI/G38/G45/G62, OS .61FX/.91FX glow, YS .91FZ glow, Saito FA-90/FA-125/FA-300T 4-stroke glow, Chinese .46/.21 RC 2-stroke glow clones, DLA-32/DLA-56 UAV engines); all scripts idempotent, batch-insert 500 at a time, --dry-run and --limit=N; triggered via GitHub Actions workflow_dispatch with source dropdown: training-data / training-data-2-marine / training-data-3-dirtbikes / training-data-4-everything / training-data-5-cruisers / training-data-6-sport / training-data-7-commercial / training-data-8-arborist / training-data-9-clones / training-data-10-rc2stroke / nhtsa-motorcycle / nhtsa-all / kaggle-motos / epa-engines; cleanup-thin-entries.mjs removes wiki entries whose current revision has fewer than N non-empty fields (default 10); cleanup-duplicates.mjs finds entries with the same make+model (case-insensitive) and deletes all but the best (winner = most fields, then most views, then newest); remove-sample-entries.mjs deletes all is_sample=true entries — all triggered via .github/workflows/wiki-cleanup.yml task dropdown (full-cleanup / deduplicate / thin-entries / remove-samples), defaults dry-run=true; full-cleanup runs deduplicate then thin-entries in one pass; deletes contributions + revisions before entries to satisfy FK constraints; wikipedia-import.mjs fetches machine specs from Wikipedia infoboxes — expanded to 51 brand entries across 5 categories: ope (Stihl/Husqvarna/Echo/Makita/Dolmar/Jonsered/Partner/McCulloch/Poulan/Shindaiwa/RedMax/Tanaka/Zenoah/Toro/Ariens/Gravely/Scag/Ferris/Exmark/Snapper), engine (Honda/Kawasaki/Briggs & Stratton/Kohler/Robin/Tecumseh/Lombardini), marine (Yamaha/Mercury Marine/Evinrude/Johnson/Tohatsu/Suzuki), motorcycle (Honda/Yamaha/Kawasaki/Suzuki/KTM/BMW/Ducati/Triumph/Harley-Davidson/Aprilia/Indian/Royal Enfield/Moto Guzzi/MV Agusta/Benelli/Beta/GasGas/Husqvarna/Sherco), atv (Polaris/Can-Am/Arctic Cat/Ski-Doo/Sea-Doo); parses infobox fields including motorcycle-specific bore×stroke split field, engine free-text (extracts cc/cooling/cylinders/valvetrain), wotPower, torqueNm, topSpeed, wheelbaseMm, seatHeightMm, groundClearanceMm, frameType; normalises units and enum values; skips entries with <10 spec fields and duplicate slugs; inserts via batchInsert; category pagination (cmcontinue) handles large categories like Honda/Yamaha/Kawasaki motorcycles (200+ members each); triggered via .github/workflows/wikipedia-import.yml with category dropdown (all/motorcycle/ope/marine/atv/engine), optional make filter, dry-run flag; timeout extended to 180 min for full runs | Admin only |
| Wiki discovery: headline stats + recently-added + labelled lists | ✅ | WikiHomePage.jsx + getWikiStats()/getRecentWikiEntries() in wiki.js — default (no-query) view shows "N machines documented · N contributions" headline (getWikiStats counts non-sample wiki_entries + wiki_contributions rows), a labelled "Recently added" strip (getRecentWikiEntries, 6 newest by created_at) above the "Most viewed" list (searchWiki("") ordered by view_count); most-viewed list deduped against the recently-added strip so entries don't repeat; default list is now ungated (loads for everyone including logged-out visitors on the wiki subdomain — previously gated behind profile?.id, leaving anon visitors an empty state); all counts read against existing wiki RLS (wiki_contributions has a public SELECT policy for non-sample entries) — no schema/policy change | Free |
| Wiki entry: contributor social proof | ✅ | WikiEntryPage.jsx + getEntryContributorCount() in wiki.js — "✓ Specs confirmed by N mechanics" badge (accent chip) below the last-updated attribution; N = distinct user_ids in wiki_contributions for the entry; visible to logged-out visitors too (public SELECT policy); surfaces the wiki_contributions table which was previously written on publish but never read anywhere | Free |
| Profile: wiki contribution stats | ✅ | ProfileSettings.jsx + getMyContributionStats() in wiki.js — "Wiki Contributions" card under the Profile section showing two stat tiles: "N machines enriched" (distinct entry_ids in wiki_contributions for the user) + "N spec edits" (count of wiki_revisions where edited_by = user); only shown for non-guests with at least one contribution; turns previously-collected-but-unused contribution data into a visible reputation surface | Free |
| Wiki SEO prerendering (static) | ✅ | scripts/prerender-wiki.mjs + netlify.toml (build command `npm run build && npm run prerender`) + public/robots.txt — the app is a client-rendered SPA, so crawlers saw an empty #root for every wiki entry; the prerender step runs after vite build, fetches all non-sample wiki_entries + their current revision data from Supabase (VITE_SUPABASE_URL/ANON_KEY, already in Netlify env), and writes dist/<slug>.html per entry: a copy of the built index.html with a real <title>, meta description built from key specs, canonical → https://wiki.ratbench.net/<slug> (dedupes the app-domain copies Netlify also serves), OpenGraph + Twitter tags, and a crawler-visible <article> spec block injected into #root (the SPA boots and replaces it for humans, so app runtime is unchanged); also emits dist/sitemap.xml listing all entry URLs, referenced by robots.txt. Robust: missing Supabase env or a failed fetch logs and exits 0 so the SPA still deploys; reserved slugs (terms/privacy/data-retention/m/assets/sitemap/robots/…) are skipped so app/SPA routes aren't shadowed; Netlify serves the static <slug>.html before the `/* → /index.html 200` SPA fallback. Freshness = build-time snapshot: new/edited entries appear on next deploy — .github/workflows/wiki-rebuild-nightly.yml fires a Netlify build hook nightly (02:30 AEST) + on manual dispatch to keep current; requires a one-time NETLIFY_BUILD_HOOK repo secret (Netlify → Build hooks), no-ops cleanly until set. Templating verified via PRERENDER_SELFTEST=1; the actual Supabase fetch only runs during the Netlify build (sandbox proxy blocks supabase.co). Note: wiki HOME (subdomain root) still serves the generic shell — same index.html is shared by both hosts, so per-host root SEO would need a host-based rewrite; entry pages (the long-tail SEO prize) are covered | Free |
